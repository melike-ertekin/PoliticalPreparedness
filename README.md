This is the 5th project(Capstone Project) for Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree Program. 

Project rubric is [here! ](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2848/view)

## Project Overview

In this project, students will build an application that provides civic data intended to provide educational opportunities to the U.S. electorate using data provided by the Google Civic Information API. Students will use data from this API to allow users to track information on target representatives and voting initiatives where applicable.

Users will be able to target a specific location and retrieve the associated civic data, displaying it to the user, and providing a clean user experience for consumption. Users will be able to save predefined locations for quick access and mark preferred representatives and policy outcomes. Where available, elections and voter information will also be provided, notifying the users on upcoming elections and providing access to associated information and saved data.

## Target Milestones
1) Create the design document and construct the basic application UI.
2) Integrate the API so that the application can pull civic data for a provided address and store locally. Allow users to mark preferred candidates.
3) Register the API in the Google Developer Console and ensure the application can connect.
4) Expand API functionality to include ballot data for provided locations and corresponding user selections.
5) Enable user-level authentication and data storage. Expand location selection to use geo-location to generate address information. Refine and enhance UI.
